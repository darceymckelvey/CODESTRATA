# CodeStrata Project Change Log

## 2025-02-25
- Initial chat and project setup
- Connected to MySQL database (mydb)
- Explored project structure and codebase
- Set up tracking for future conversations to maintain context

## 2025-02-25 (Update)
I've completed a comprehensive exploration of the CodeStrata project. Here's what I discovered:

### Project Concept
CodeStrata is a geological-themed Git CLI and learning platform that transforms version control into intuitive geological terminology, with commands like:
- `strata create-vault` (git init)
- `strata fossilize` (git commit)
- `strata stratum-shift` (git branch)

### Key Components
1. **CLI Tool**: A Node.js command-line interface that wraps Git commands with geological terms
2. **Backend**: Express.js server with Sequelize ORM connecting to MySQL
3. **Frontend**: Angular application with Material UI components
4. **Database**: MySQL schema with tables for users, repositories, learning paths, and progress tracking

### Notable Features
- Geological metaphors for Git operations (commits = fossils, branches = strata layers)
- User authentication system with JWT and role-based access
- GitHub integration for repository connections
- Learning path creation and progress tracking
- Review system for educational content

I've explored all major components of the system, including database models, API endpoints, authentication flows, and frontend components. All this information has been stored in memory for future reference.

### Database Credentials
- Host: localhost
- Username: root
- Password: Anim8ors123!!!
- Database: mydb

### Database Schema (mydb)
The MySQL database contains the following tables:

1. **LithoProfiles** (User Profiles):
   - Fields: id, username, email, password_hash, role (enum: student/instructor/admin), profile_data (json), created_at, updated_at
   - Primary user table with authentication and role management

2. **strata_vaults** (Code Repositories):
   - Fields: id, profile_id, name, repository_uri, current_branch, created_at, updated_at, path, description, artifacts (json), strata (json)
   - Manages code repositories for users

3. **Fosilizes** (Version Control):
   - Fields: id, vault_id, commit_hash, message, commited_at
   - Tracks git commits and changes

4. **CoreSamples** (Learning Exercises):
   - Fields: id, layer_id, title, instructions, starter_code, points, created_at
   - Represents individual coding exercises/challenges

5. **TerrainPaths** (Learning Paths):
   - Fields: id, creator_id, name, description, is_active, is_public, created_at, TerrainReviews_id
   - Represents course/learning paths

6. **TerrainProgress** (Learning Progress):
   - Fields: id, profile_id, path_id, current_layer, enrolled_at
   - Tracks user progress through learning paths

7. **TerrainReviews** (Path Review System):
   - Fields: id, path_id, reviewer_id, review_status (enum: pending/approved/rejected), feedback, reviewed_at
   - Manages review process for learning paths

### Project Structure Overview
- Backend (Node.js/Express with TypeScript)
- Frontend (Angular application)
- CLI tool for project commands
- Documentation resources

## 2025-02-25 (GitHub OAuth Implementation)
I've successfully implemented and fixed the GitHub OAuth authentication flow for the CodeStrata project. Here's a summary of the changes:

### GitHub OAuth Implementation
1. **Backend Changes**:
   - Implemented `githubLogin` and `githubCallback` methods in `auth.controller.ts`
   - Added proper state parameter handling for CSRF protection
   - Implemented user creation/update with GitHub profile data
   - Fixed JWT token generation and refresh token implementation
   - Added comprehensive error handling with detailed logs
   - Correctly configured environment variables for GitHub credentials

2. **Frontend Changes**:
   - Updated the Angular route for GitHub callback (`/auth/github-callback`)
   - Fixed state verification in the GitHub callback component
   - Updated the vault service to properly handle the GitHub authentication
   - Ensured proper redirection with token handling
   - Added error handling for OAuth flow issues

3. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Configured GitHub OAuth application with proper redirect URIs
   - Set up the correct environment variables:
     ```
     GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=Ov23lihjSuTuFWvjj43F
     GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=4aad4a1105efde4cb4da43983878i298b8ebe996
     GITHUB_CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:3000/api/auth/github/callback
     ```

4. **Fixed Issues**:
   - Resolved "Invalid state parameter" error by improving state verification
   - Fixed "Failed to obtain access token" error by using correct GitHub credentials
   - Addressed cross-domain issues between frontend and backend
   - Improved error handling and debugging for OAuth flow
   - Updated redirect URIs to correctly maintain the authentication flow

### Debugging Techniques
- Added detailed console logging for OAuth parameters
- Implemented try/catch blocks with error-specific messaging
- Created a mock GitHub service for testing/development
- Fixed environment variable loading for reliable configuration

## 2025-02-25 (GitHub OAuth Enhancement)
### GitHub OAuth Authentication Fixes
- Added a new public `handleGithubAuthSuccess` method in `AuthService` to properly set authentication state after GitHub OAuth
- Modified GitHub callback component to use the new public method and avoid accessing private methods
- Updated the callback procedure to ensure proper token storage and authentication state setting
- Added detailed debug logging to track the entire authentication flow
- Improved error handling for OAuth failure cases

### Error Handling Improvements
- Enhanced the GitHub callback component to use the centralized `ErrorHandlerService` for consistent error handling
- Updated `handleErosion` method to use the standardized error display mechanism
- Improved error message formatting using `getDisplayErrorMessage` for user-friendly notifications
- Simplified error redirection flow to login page after authentication failures

### Debugging Enhancements
- Added comprehensive logging in `VaultService.handleGithubCallback` method
- Implemented token validation logging to verify proper token receipt and storage
- Added API URL logging to verify correct endpoint configuration
- Improved user data logging with proper data sanitization for security

### Redirect Flow Optimization
- Fixed the redirect issue by ensuring authentication state is properly set before navigation
- Added slight delay to navigation to ensure state changes are processed
- Enhanced console logging to track the navigation process
- Ensured consistent user experience by providing appropriate feedback during authentication

The GitHub OAuth integration now allows users to authenticate with their GitHub accounts, creating a seamless sign-in experience and enabling repository connections for the CodeStrata platform.

This changelog will be updated with all changes and discussions to maintain context between chat sessions.
